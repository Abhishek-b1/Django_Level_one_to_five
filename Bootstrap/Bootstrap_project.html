            <p>There are four types of paragraphs that you need to know about: descriptive, narrative, expository, and
                persuasive. A quick search around the internet will yield other types, but to keep this simple, it's a
                good idea to consider just these four.the descriptive paragraph: This type of paragraph describes
                something and shows the reader what a thing or a person is like. The words chosen in the description
                often appeal to the five senses of touch, smell, sight, sound, and taste. Descriptive paragraphs can
                be artistic and may deviate from grammatical norms. the narrative paragraph: This type of paragraph
                tells a story. There's a sequence of action or there's a clear beginning, middle, and end to the
                paragraph. the expository paragraph: This type of paragraph explains something or provides instruction.
                It could also describe a process and move the reader step by step through a method. This type of
                paragraph often requires research, but it's possible that the writer is able to rely on his or her
                own knowledge and expertise. the persuasive paragraph: This type of paragraph tries to get the reader
                to accept a particular point of view or understand the writer's position. This is the type of paragraph
                that many teachers focus on because it's useful when building an argument. It often requires the
                collection of facts and research. It important to point out that many paragraphs are a combination
                of these four types, but for the purpose of instruction, let's consider some examples of each: This is
                a descriptive paragraph: The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the
                orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is
                easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word . The groups change
                more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are
                wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become from
                a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the
                sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light. This excerpt is taken
                from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In this paragraph you can hear, see, and feel the setting
                in which the story takes place. When you practice writing a descriptive paragraph yourself, you should
                address all aspects of the physical world. This is a narrative paragraph: It's been almost ten years
                since I first ran for political office. I was thirty-five at the time, four years out of law school,
                recently married, and generally impatient with life. A seat in the Illinois legislature had opened up,
                and several friends suggested that I run, thinking that my work as a civil rights lawyer, and contacts
                from my days as a community organizer, would make me a viable candidate. After discussing it with my
                wife, I entered the race and proceeded to do what every first-time candidate does: I talked to anyone
                who would listen. I went to block club meetings and church socials, beauty shops and barbershops. If
                two guys were standing on a corner, I would cross the street to hand them campaign literature. And
                everywhere I went, I'd get some version of the same two questions. This opening paragraph from
                Barack Obama's The Audacity of Hope tell and interesting story about how a man entered the arena of
                politics. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and it raises the reader's curiosity about what
                will happen next. </p>
